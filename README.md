# treeviewer

This is a pet project to help me learn Rust. But maybe it’ll end up being of actual use for someone?

The idea is to write a program that, given an input of slash-separated paths, provide a console-based tree viewer that will help visualizing these paths – with folding/unfolding subtrees, searching, etc.
